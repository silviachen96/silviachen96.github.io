         <h2>Urban Linker Website Design</h2>
         <h3>October 5, 2016</h3>
         <img src="http://beforebigbang.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/urbanlinker.jpg"/>
         <p>POPPING!</p>

         <p>That is the first thing I think of when I open the Urban Linker website design.
           The modular rectangle and square shapes really keep the whole website parallel and segmental.
           The text font used in the website really strikes a casual yet solemn tone. Many of the
           photographs used on the website are aesthetically pleasing and attractive to the eye which
           really catches the attention of the audience members. One interesting thing is that when you
           scroll over items on the website page, it interacts by either moving or something new slides
           over which makes the audience want to play around with the website. The website is very clear
           and consistent on what links to press if you are looking for a specific thing. The color scheme
           and layout of the website is very constant on every single page which brings together the website
           as a united whole. The usability is very efficient and the way the website layout is designed really
           persuades the audience to explore around.</p>

           <h2>My First Coding Experience</h2>
           <h3> October 10, 2016</h3>

           </h1>

           <p>Coding the other webpage for Our Roasters was actually easier than I thought it would be.
             I thought it was really helpful that I already had most of the coding, it was just a test
             to see which part of the actual code I needed to copy and paste and what small things I
             needed to add. One thing that I believe that is really important when I was coding is to always
             check my spelling and for the little mistakes, because if you forget to type in a tiny semicolon
             or carelessly typed a word wrong, the whole code does not work. When the whole code doesn’t work,
             you would have to go back and check every single thing again which can be tiring. Furthermore,
             the feeling you get when your code works is one of the happiest feelings in the world.  It is
             like a mixture of relief, anxiety, and proudness. In general, I am really enjoying coding and
             believe this is a very good skill to have as a designer.</p>

             <h2>Animation in a Nutshell</h2>
             <h3> October 20, 2016</h3>
             <p>I absolutely loved this article. It is a really good resource for anyone who is interested in
               creating web animation. For interface animation to be effective, it should combine form and function,
               aid in orientation, direct attention, show causality, and express the brand’s personality. The author,
               Val Head, does an excellent job of balancing the purpose and style of web animation and it is good practice
               for web designers, UX professionals, and developers. Animation is actually something that I am really interested on.
               As of today, “animation” is actually a very popular topic. I was shocked to find out that it is now
               possible to create effective animation using the same technologies that we’ve been using to build websites.
               That’s shocking and pretty cool! This book really highlights the fun and success of creating animation and
               Val writes about in style. I believe that understanding animation is now very crucial for designers and
               develops, and it is definitely something I want to know more about in the future. I recommend this article
               to anybody who wants to understand the theory of animation!</p>
