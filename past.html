         <h1> Past: What Inspired It All </h1>
         <h2>Late 1870s</h2>
         <p>In the late 1870s, an inventor from Rhode Island was putting the
            finishing touches on a stylographic fountain pen, a type of pen which
            utilized a wire to act as a valve in applying ink to paper. In October
            1880 that inventor, Alonzo T. Cross, was issued U.S. Patent No. 232804,
            issued under the title Stylographic Pen. This innovation provided a
            screw-plug to prevent users from filling ink into an air tube included in
            the pen’s housing and used the motion of air bubbles moving from the
            air tube into the ink chamber to force ink through to the point of the pen.</p>

            <h2>1945</h2>
            <p>On December 11th, 1945, Bíró was issued U.S. Patent No. 2390636,
              which is titled Writing Instrument, to protect his innovation. It claims a
              writing instrument with a reservoir for charging dense ink as well as a
              n air intake and a free ball tip. This invention did away with the problem
              of ink evaporation which requires frequent refilling of the ink chamber.
              This first ballpoint pen relied on gravity to draw ink towards the tip,
              requiring the user to hold the pen perfectly upright in order to write.
              Again with the help of his brother George, László was able to develop
              a pen which used capillary action to draw the ink towards the tip.
              A rough ball in the tip sponged up the ink and applied it evenly to a
              surface without the use of gravity.</p>

              <h2>Unknown Date: BIC 4-Color Pen</h2>
              <p>Bic 4C represented one of the early triumphs of democracy-in-design
                action. The pen was made to be popular, accessible and inexpensive.
                The consumer was given a semblance of choice, with each of the
                pen's cardinal directions representing a particular color ink. Arguably,
                it was part of a small group of products that combined over a period
                of time to create the 'expectation of color choice' that today's iMac
                has so compellingly capitalized on.</p>

              <p>On the negative side, the Bic 4C came out at a time when pens
                were made to be disposable. It represented the apotheosis of
                disposable writing instruments -- the frankly terrible notion that not
                only could resources be tossed aside once even a portion of them
                was used up, but the idea that entire mechanisms could be disposed
                of wholesale as well. Ecologically speaking, the Bic 4C was a couple
                of cartridges short of a six-pack.</p>
