	      		<h3>Cara Delevingne</h3>
	      		<p> I used Adobe Illustrator to create a vector image of the actress/ model of Cara Delevingne. With the original image behind my artwork, I outlined
							the different colored values of the shadows on her face. After filling the images with the specific color value of black, I changed
							the transparency and opacity level to allow certain things from the original image to show up such as her lips and hair lines. This creates
							a sense of pop art. It was challenging to figure out the right color and shade of the black while trying to master the pen tool on Adobe Illustrator.</p>

            <h3>Whole Earth Festival</h3>
            <p> I created an event poster for the UC Davis Whole Earth Festival. Last year, I remember very
						clearly playing with colored dust and sand and that was why that became the focus of my poster. Originally the colors
					  were different, but I used the color replacement tool on Photoshop to replace the original colors with colors that
					  represented the Earth. I cropped out an image of a heartbeat made with plants in order to capture the main idea of the
					  festival. I used the smudge tool to create the smoky effect in the top left corner. In general, this was a fun poster
					  to make and trying out new tools on Adobe Creative Cloud.</p>

            <h3>Stephen Hawking</h3>
            <p> I created a poster on Stephen Hawking and his contributions to the
            	science field. His theory of time and space can be seen in the
							background of stars and the image of the clock in order to represent the themee and topic of his
							findings. I wanted to add in something that couldn't be seen by the human eye until looking up close, so I
							added in a white silhouette of him in the background. I took my time to play with the opacity and transparency
							of various images, in addition to figuring out how to layer them in a neat order. The font color was
							difficult to choose, but I went with white because I felt like it popped out more than usual.</p>
