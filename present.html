         <p> If you get your creativity kicks by putting a pen to paper, or a stylus
              to your electronic device, but want to do it in the accurate colors of
              your world, your wish may have come true. The Scribble Pen uses "smart ink"
              technology to accurately mix the ink to the color you select with the
              RGB color sensor scanner at the back end of the pen. </p>

         <p>Scribble offers the pen for paper, the Scribble Smart Stylus for electronic
             devices, and the Motley Pen for kids. All the Scribble Pens have a color scanner
             at one end and a pen or stylus tip at the other. They come with a selection of
             drawing tips to control stroke weight. The refillable ink cartridges connect to
             a smart micro pump that creates the custom color you have scanned when you want
             it. Colors are coded as Pantone, CMYK and HEX as well as RGB and can be saved in a
             custom library.</p>

           <h2>RGB Color Sensor</h2>
           <p>The built in color sensor lets you easily
              capture any color- simply point it at an object
              or surface and press the button! Draw or write
              with it right away, or save it to sync with your
              mobile devices. Looking closer at the sensor, the RGB sensor is covered with a shaded glass.
              The glass acts as an impact on the true value of light that reaches the sensor. The sensor
              collects light through red, green, and blue filter, like how a digital camera captures
              things. What helps the sensor scan colors is its magic weapon of another filter,
              called the "C" filter which means "clear". The fourth channel measures all the light
              together: red, green, and blue. The extra channel lets you get better sensitivity when the
              light is low, since the C channel sees about three times more light. </p>

            <h2>Multiple Drawing Tips</h2>
            <p>The Scribble Pen comes with three different
                sizes of drawing tip, allowing you the freedom
                to express yourself as neatly or boldy as you like.
                Scribble is perfect for both drawing and accurate
                writing.</p>

              <h2>Refillable Ink Cartridge</h2>
              <p>The Scribble Pen comes with three different
                 sizes of drawing tip, allowing you the freedom
                 to express yourself as neatly or boldy as you like.
                 Scribble is perfect for both drawing and accurate
                 writing.Scribble's technologically advanced ink is
                 lightfast and water-resistant - no matter the weather,
                 it won't fade away.</p>

              <p>The real question is how is the ink able to come out in the
                color it wants? According to a blog called, "Scribble Pen, a
                real Color Picker Pen?" by John the Math Guy, research says that
                the Scribble Pen might possible have a patent from a company called
                HP and it is titled a "Writing Instrument with user-controlled ink color".
                Ink jet heads from at least three inks (CMY) feed into a tiny mixing chamber,
                where it is transferred to the roller ball. The HP invention embodied a
                color sensor or a scanner. This scanner detects photons of a particular
                wavelength for example color. Then, when the scanner scans a color, the
                three elements of the CCD array will output signals indicative of the
                ratio of each of the 3 primary colors in the scanned color. Consequently,
                the user can sample a color with the scanner from any object at hand. The
                pen will then write in that sampled color. </p>

              <h2>Scribble Goes Green!</h2>
              <p>One of the most outstanding features of the Scribble is that, since
                it can reproduce any color, it replaces thousands of marking pens,
                thereby greatly reducing the huge amount of plastic waste cluttering
                up our landfills all over the world. Designers not only made a pen with
                high technologicacl advances, they also made it with the idea of helping the
                Earth and environment.</p>
