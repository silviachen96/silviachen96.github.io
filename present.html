         <p> If you get your creativity kicks by putting a pen to paper, or a stylus
              to your electronic device, but want to do it in the accurate colors of
              your world, your wish may have come true. The Scribble Pen uses "smart ink"
              technology to accurately mix the ink to the color you select with the
              RGB color sensor scanner at the back end of the pen. </p>

         <p>Scribble offers the pen for paper, the Scribble Smart Stylus for electronic
             devices, and the Motley Pen for kids. All the Scribble Pens have a color scanner
             at one end and a pen or stylus tip at the other. They come with a selection of
             drawing tips to control stroke weight. The refillable ink cartridges connect to
             a smart miscro pump that creates the custom color you have scanned when you want
             it. Colors are coded as Pantone, CMYK and HEX as well as RGB and can be saved in a
             custom library.</p>


           <h2>RGB Color Sensor</h2>
           <p>The built in color sensor lets you easily
              capture any color- simply point it at an object
              or surface and press the button! Draw or write
              with it right away, or save it to sync with your
              mobile devices.</p>
