         <h2>Rally Interactive Website Critique</h2>
         <h3> November 7, 2016</h3>
         <p>First of all, the website I clicked on just from the preview was super impressive. The icon looked so engaging
           and fun that it made me WANT to explore. And I was right. The website is an interactive studio so the audience always
           has something new to find. I think the color choices are absolutely stunning. I love how the designer used a certain
           color for each page making it a change of scenery and very fresh every time you click into a new site. The first thing
           that you see when you open the website is a huge banner that is beautifully designed which is basically the overview
           of the what the content is talking about. I love the layout and cohesive anatomy structure of the website. It really
           brings everything together.
         <p>Looking at the website on desktop, mobile, and tablet, the feel was actually quite different. To be honest, I liked it
           more on my mobile more than on my tablet and laptop. Even though the screen was small, I think the images and text popped
           out more and everything just seemed to fit perfectly in this tiny little screen which is super cool to think about. On the
           laptop, even though everything was bigger, I feel like people can get tired at looking at the site because the site is very
           busy with lots of images and text. However, on mobile, it does not really seem like it. Itâ€™s really strange actually but I
           love it.</p>
           <p>The one thing I love the most is how consistent and organized the colors are. It really adds to the aesthetic of the site.
           The pictures used were also very clever, for example, some of the pictures would slowly reveal itself when the user is scrolling
           down, which I found very appealing. In general, I appreciate the overall design of the interactive site and how it makes
           you feel!</p>
