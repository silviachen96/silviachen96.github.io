         <h2>Urban Linker Website Design</h2>
         <h3>October 5, 2016</h3>
         <p>POPPING!</p>

         <p>That is the first thing I think of when I open the Urban Linker website design.
           The modular rectangle and square shapes really keep the whole website parallel and segmental.
           The text font used in the website really strikes a casual yet solemn tone. Many of the
           photographs used on the website are aesthetically pleasing and attractive to the eye which
           really catches the attention of the audience members. One interesting thing is that when you
           scroll over items on the website page, it interacts by either moving or something new slides
           over which makes the audience want to play around with the website. The website is very clear
           and consistent on what links to press if you are looking for a specific thing. The color scheme
           and layout of the website is very constant on every single page which brings together the website
           as a united whole. The usability is very efficient and the way the website layout is designed really
           persuades the audience to explore around.</p>
