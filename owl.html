	      		<h3>The Owl</h3>
	      		<p> For this piece, I created a drawing of an owl with various shapes, lines, and colors. First, I used pen to
							outline the outside guidelines of the drawing before going in and filling in the shapes with colors using
							colored pencils. I got the idea of this owl when I was scrolling through Pinterest art pieces and I was
							inspired my someone's drawing of an owl and how she used different shapes and sizes to create an image. I thought that
							using various lines and shapes makes the owl look unique.</p>
							<p> When I was choosing the various colors that went into it, I wanted to use complementary colors in order to unify the drawing
					  as a whole, making it look more put together and aesthetically pleasing to the eye.</p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>Some challenges I had with this piece was having the patience to finish it. All the intricate details took a lot of time and
						to be honest I did not feel like finishing it. However, it took a few breaks to keep me going. The end result was worth it. Getting the
					colors to blend smoothly was hard, since the wax of colored pencils are not really good for blending. Also, I had to be very careful
				  when choosing a specific color for a specific shape, because one wrong color can make the whole thing look awkward.  </p>
