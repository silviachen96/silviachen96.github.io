	      		<h3>Dream Catchers</h3>
	      		<p>This was a piece I did in high school. My teacher assigned us a final project where we could
							draw anything we wanted, it just had to be in pen and colored pencils which fun fact are two of my
							favorite mediums. I really love bold saturated colors and making my artwork pop out. I also really
							like dream catchers and the feeling of happiness and joy they evoke which obviously inspired this piece.
							The drawing features two dream catcher earrings that are hanging on (if you could not tell) a moon. In the back of the moon, I actually
							decided to paint it yellow which resembles the moon shining.

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p> Since this was drawing which had no limitations, I did not really encounter any challenges. The only thing
						I found kind of hard was being able to draw in the shadows and gradients of the piece. I did my best to not make it look
						so flat. Originally, for the shadows I wanted to use black colored pencil but I realized that it made the shadows look to
					dramatic and it took away from the main drawing, so I decided to use the color purple which provides the shadow but does not make
					it look to extreme.</p>
