           <p>Coding the other webpage for Our Roasters was actually easier than I thought it would be.
             I thought it was really helpful that I already had most of the coding, it was just a test
             to see which part of the actual code I needed to copy and paste and what small things I
             needed to add. One thing that I believe that is really important when I was coding is to always
             check my spelling and for the little mistakes, because if you forget to type in a tiny semicolon
             or carelessly typed a word wrong, the whole code does not work. When the whole code doesnâ€™t work,
             you would have to go back and check every single thing again which can be tiring. Furthermore,
             the feeling you get when your code works is one of the happiest feelings in the world.  It is
             like a mixture of relief, anxiety, and proudness. In general, I am really enjoying coding and
             believe this is a very good skill to have as a designer.</p>
