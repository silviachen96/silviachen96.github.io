	      		<h3>Girl w/ the Blue Cap</h3>
	      		<p>This piece was done during my own free time. It was a long day and all I wanted to do was sit down and draw. This was the
						  result. I drew a girl with a blue cap, long brown hair, green eyes, and dramatic eyelashes. I used watercolors for this piece.

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p> I had so many challenges with this piece. First of all, watercolor paint is not really something I like to use, but I wanted to practice
						my skills. Getting the watercolor to turn from light to dark was extremely hard especially when painting the skin. Just trying to mix colors
					   to get the right skin tone was very hard to do. Sometimes it would be too light and I would add more paint, and sometimes it would be too dark and
					   I needed to add more water. It was very time consuming. Knowing where to paint lighter and darker in order to capture the shadows of the face was very tedious. The second thing
					 		that was challenging to do were the eyes. Since it is such a small circle, controlling the brush and getting it to stay within the borders was pretty difficult.</p>
