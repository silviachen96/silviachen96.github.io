         <h2>Animation in a Nutshell</h2>
         <h3> October 20, 2016</h3>
         <p>I absolutely loved this article. It is a really good resource for anyone who is interested in
           creating web animation. For interface animation to be effective, it should combine form and function,
           aid in orientation, direct attention, show causality, and express the brand’s personality. The author,
           Val Head, does an excellent job of balancing the purpose and style of web animation and it is good practice
           for web designers, UX professionals, and developers. Animation is actually something that I am really interested on.
           As of today, “animation” is actually a very popular topic. I was shocked to find out that it is now
           possible to create effective animation using the same technologies that we’ve been using to build websites.
           That’s shocking and pretty cool! This book really highlights the fun and success of creating animation and
           Val writes about in style. I believe that understanding animation is now very crucial for designers and
           develops, and it is definitely something I want to know more about in the future. I recommend this article
           to anybody who wants to understand the theory of animation!</p>
