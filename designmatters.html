      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <img src="http://beforebigbang.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/urbanlinker.jpg"/>
      <p>That is the first thing I think of when I open the Urban Linker website design.
        The modular rectangle and square shapes really keep the whole website parallel and segmental.
        The text font used in the website really strikes a casual yet solemn tone. Many of the
        photographs used on the website are aesthetically pleasing and attractive to the eye which
        really catches the attention of the audience members. One interesting thing is that when you
        scroll over items on the website page, it interacts by either moving or something new slides
        over which makes the audience want to play around with the website. The website is very clear
        and consistent on what links to press if you are looking for a specific thing. The color scheme
        and layout of the website is very constant on every single page which brings together the website
        as a united whole. The usability is very efficient and the way the website layout is designed really
        persuades the audience to explore around.</p>

        <h2>My First Coding Experience</h2>
        <p>Coding the other webpage for Our Roasters was actually easier than I thought it would be.
          I thought it was really helpful that I already had most of the coding, it was just a test
          to see which part of the actual code I needed to copy and paste and what small things I
          needed to add. One thing that I believe that is really important when I was coding is to always
          check my spelling and for the little mistakes, because if you forget to type in a tiny semicolon
          or carelessly typed a word wrong, the whole code does not work. When the whole code doesnâ€™t work,
          you would have to go back and check every single thing again which can be tiring. Furthermore,
          the feeling you get when your code works is one of the happiest feelings in the world.  It is
          like a mixture of relief, anxiety, and proudness. In general, I am really enjoying coding and
          believe this is a very good skill to have as a designer.</p>
